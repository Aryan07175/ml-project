🏠 Bengaluru House Price Prediction & Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting house prices in Bengaluru using real-world real estate data. It combines Python-based data analysis, machine learning regression models, and Power BI dashboards to transform raw housing data into meaningful insights that help buyers, investors, and analysts make informed decisions.

The project covers the complete data science pipeline — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to price prediction and interactive visualization.

🎯 Problem Statement

The real estate market in Bengaluru is highly dynamic, with house prices influenced by multiple factors such as location, total area, number of bedrooms (BHK), and market demand.
However, raw housing data is often inconsistent, incomplete, and difficult to interpret.

This project aims to:
Clean and standardize real estate data.
Analyze pricing trends and key influencing factors

Build regression models to predict house prices

Present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard

📌 Results & Insights


2BHK and 3BHK properties dominate the market


Price per square foot varies significantly across locations


Outliers exist in both pricing and property size


Location and total area are strong price influencers


The Power BI dashboard makes these insights easy to explore for non-technical users.

🚧 Challenges Faced
